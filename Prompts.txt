--- Product_Performance_Analysis ---

Prompt 1:
prompt = f"""
I'm analyzing product performance for a retail dataset.

Here are my findings:
{top5}

Help me understand:
1. What patterns are most significant?
2. Why might these patterns exist?
3. What business implications do they have?

Prompt 2:

Here are my findings:
{top5}

Now take it a step further. Based on the data, help me explore:
- Customer segmentation: which customer types are most affected and how might we target them better?
- Seasonality: is there any indication that time of year may be affecting these numbers?
- Competitor analysis: how might our competitors be influencing this performance?
- Product lifecycle: which stage is each subcategory in (introduction, growth, maturity, decline), and how does that influence strategy?

Prompt 3:
prompt = f"""
Here are the top performing products:
{top5}

Help me analyze what is driving product profitability.

Which factors (e.g., discount rate, sales volume) most influence profit in each subcategory?
Is there evidence that discounting helps or hurts profitability in these examples?

Provide guidance I can use to prioritize which products or categories to push harder.

Prompt 4:
prompt = f"""
Given the following product performance summary:
{top5}

Compare these subcategories by sales, profit, and average discount.
Which categories are performing best overall, and which might be underperforming or over-discounted?
Highlight any surprising relationships or tradeoffs.
"""
response = model.generate_content(prompt)
print(response.text)

Prompt 5:
prompt = f"""
Based on this product performance data:
{top5}

Make strategic recommendations:
- Which products should we prioritize in promotions?
- Which categories need pricing or discount strategy revisions?
- Are any subcategories showing signs of decline or low ROI?

Frame your advice like a product analyst guiding a retail strategy meeting.

Dataset Statistics:
- Number of rows: 9994
- Number of columns: 19
- Data types: Mix of object (strings), int64, and float64.
- Descriptive statistics for numerical columns:
{df.describe().to_markdown()}
- Count of unique values per column:
{df.nunique().to_markdown()}
- Sum of null values per column:
{df.isnull().sum().to_markdown()}

Based on these statistics, what potential data quality issues can you identify and what SQL validation queries would you suggest to verify them?
