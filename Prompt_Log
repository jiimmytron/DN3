Prompt:
Here's comprehensive Python code to analyze the quality of your pandas DataFrame:This comprehensive analysis code will provide you with:

**Key Features:**
- **Completeness**: Detects missing values AND empty strings with visualizations
- **Duplicates**: Identifies duplicate records with counts and examples
- **Data Types**: Categorizes columns by type (numeric, categorical, datetime, boolean)
- **Outliers**: Uses IQR method to detect outliers with bounds
- **Distribution**: Box plots, histograms, and skewness analysis
- **Additional Checks**: Memory usage, correlation matrix, high cardinality detection

**Usage:**
Just run this after your BigQuery data load:
```python
# Your existing code
query = f"SELECT * FROM `{from_table}`"
df = client.query(query).to_dataframe()

# Run the quality analysis
analyze_dataframe_quality(df)
```

The analysis will generate:
- Detailed console output with statistics
- Missing data heatmaps
- Box plots for outlier detection
- Distribution histograms
- Correlation heatmaps for numeric columns

This should give you a comprehensive view of your data quality and help identify areas that need attention before further analysis!

LLM: Claude

Prompt: I need to perform basic analysis of a dataset in order to obtain statistics that are necessary for an LLM to suggest engineered fields and further analysis. What are these statistics? Please suggest Python code needed to calculate them for dataframe df.

Response: Here are the key statistics an LLM needs to suggest engineered fields and further analysis:This comprehensive analysis provides the essential statistics an LLM needs to suggest feature engineering opportunities:

**Key Categories of Statistics:**

1. **Basic Dataset Info**: Shape, memory usage, duplicates, missing values
2. **Column-Level Analysis**: Data types, missing data patterns, uniqueness, distributions
3. **Correlation Analysis**: Relationships between numeric variables
4. **Categorical Analysis**: Cardinality, frequency distributions, binary flags
5. **DateTime Analysis**: Temporal patterns and ranges
6. **Business Insights**: Potential IDs, targets, problematic columns

**Why These Matter for Feature Engineering:**

- **Missing data patterns** → Imputation strategies
- **High correlations** → Feature selection, multicollinearity issues
- **Skewness/outliers** → Transformation needs
- **High cardinality categoricals** → Encoding strategies
- **DateTime ranges** → Time-based feature opportunities
- **Business context** → Domain-specific feature ideas

Run `analyze_dataset_for_feature_engineering(df)` to get a complete statistical profile that will help an LLM suggest relevant engineered features based on your data's characteristics.

Prompt: I have a dataframe with the following columns:

'order_id', 'order_date', 'ship_date', 'customer', 'manufactory',
       'product_name', 'segment', 'category', 'subcategory', 'region', 'zip',
       'city', 'state', 'discount', 'profit', 'quantity', 'sales',
       'profit_margin'
Please suggest Python code to engineer the following fields:

Order Processing Time: ship_date - order_date. This helps understand efficiency and potential customer satisfaction impacts related to shipping speed. Order Month: Extract the month from order_date. This allows analysis of seasonality trends. **Order Year: Extract the year from order_date. This helps track year-over-year performance. *Order Day of Week: Extract the day of the week from order_date. This might reveal trends related to weekdays vs. weekends. *Order Quarter: Calculate the quarter of the year from order_date. Useful for quarterly performance reporting and identifying trends within a year. Customer-based features: *Customer Lifetime Value (CLV): Although this would require additional data (e.g., past purchase history for each customer), it's a crucial metric for understanding customer profitability. *Customer Segmentation (RFM): Using Recency, Frequency, and Monetary value (which can be derived from the existing data) to segment customers would enable targeted marketing campaigns and personalized offers. Recency can be calculated as the difference between the last order date in the dataset and each customer's most recent order date. Frequency would be the number of orders per customer. Monetary value would be the total sales per customer. *Average Order Value (AOV): total_sales / total_orders per customer. This reveals spending habits and can be used to identify high-value customers. Product/Order-based features: *Unit Price: sales / quantity. This allows for direct price comparisons between products and can be useful in analyzing pricing strategies and their impact on sales. *Product Margin: profit / sales. While profit_margin exists, ensure it's consistent with this calculation and investigate any discrepancies. A granular product margin can identify highly profitable and less profitable items. *Order Total: While not explicitly needed if you can aggregate sales by order_id, having a dedicated order_total field can simplify some calculations. *Discount Amount: sales  discount*. This helps quantify the impact of discounts on revenue and profitability. * Is Discounted: A binary flag indicating whether a product was discounted or not. Useful for quickly filtering and analyzing discounted vs. non-discounted sales. Geographic features: *Region/State Performance:** Combining region and state to possibly uncover finer-grained geographical trends and performance variations. Although region and state exist, you might find creating combined categories helpful depending on your analysis.
all field names should be lowercase and have underscores instead of spaces in their names.

Response: This comprehensive feature engineering code creates all the requested features with proper naming conventions (lowercase with underscores). Here's what it generates:

**Time-based Features:**
- `order_processing_time` - Days between order and ship dates
- `order_month`, `order_year`, `order_day_of_week`, `order_quarter` - Temporal extractions

**Customer-based Features:**
- `customer_recency` - Days since last order
- `customer_frequency` - Total number of orders
- `customer_monetary_value` - Total sales per customer
- `customer_avg_order_value` - Average order value per customer
- `customer_rfm_segment` - RFM-based customer segmentation (Champions, Loyal Customers, etc.)

**Product/Order-based Features:**
- `unit_price` - Sales divided by quantity
- `calculated_profit_margin` - Profit divided by sales (for verification)
- `discount_amount` - Dollar amount of discount applied
- `is_discounted` - Binary flag (1 if discounted, 0 if not)
- `order_total` - Total sales amount per order ID

**Geographic Features:**
- `region_state` - Combined region and state identifier

**Bonus Features:**
- `profit_per_unit` - Profit divided by quantity
- `discount_category` - Categorical grouping of discount levels
- `order_size_category` - Small/Medium/Large/Bulk based on quantity
- `sales_performance_category` - Quartile-based sales performance

I need to investigate the relationship between a set of dataframe fields

and target fields:
'sales', 'profit_margin', 'profit', 'calculated_profit_margin', 'revenue_per_unit', 'profit_per_unit', 'sales_performance_category'

Some fields are numeric, some categorical, some - just labels (e.g., zip code).

Please suggest an approach and Python code.

Edit
Here's a comprehensive approach to investigate relationships between your features and target variables:


Comprehensive Feature-Target Relationship Analysis
Code 
This comprehensive analysis approach provides:

Multi-Method Analysis:
Correlation Analysis - For numeric feature-target relationships
ANOVA - For categorical features vs numeric targets
Chi-Square Tests - For categorical feature-categorical target relationships
Descriptive Statistics - Group-wise summaries
Key Features:
Automatic Feature Categorization - Intelligently classifies your features as numeric, categorical, identifiers, or temporal
Statistical Significance Testing - Provides p-values and effect sizes
Ranked Results - Orders relationships by strength
Executive Summary - Highlights the most important findings
Usage:
python
# Define your feature and target lists
feature_cols = ['order_id', 'order_date', 'ship_date', 'customer', 'manufactory', 
                'product_name', 'segment', 'category', 'subcategory', 'region', 
                'zip', 'city', 'state', 'discount', 'quantity', 'order_processing_time', 
                'order_month', 'order_year', 'order_day_of_week', 'order_quarter', 
                'customer_frequency', 'customer_monetary_value', 'customer_unique_orders', 
                'customer_recency', 'customer_avg_order_value', 'customer_rfm_segment', 
                'unit_price', 'discount_amount', 'is_discounted', 'order_total', 
                'region_state', 'revenue_per_unit', 'profit_per_unit', 'discount_category', 
                'order_size_category']

target_cols = ['sales', 'profit_margin', 'profit', 'calculated_profit_margin', 
               'revenue_per_unit', 'profit_per_unit', 'sales_performance_category']

# Run the analysis
results = run_complete_analysis(df, feature_cols, target_cols)
The code will automatically handle different data types and provide actionable insights about which features most strongly predict your target variables!

ValueError: could not convert string to float: 'Tuesday'
Edit
The error occurs because the code is trying to calculate correlations between string values (like 'Tuesday' from order_day_of_week) and numeric targets. Let me fix the feature categorization to properly handle different data types:


Comprehensive Feature-Target Relationship Analysis
Code ∙ Version 2 

Comprehensive Feature-Target Relationship Analysis
Code ∙ Version 3 

Comprehensive Feature-Target Relationship Analysis
Code ∙ Version 4 
The main issues were:

Mixed data types in correlation analysis - The code was trying to correlate string values like 'Tuesday' with numeric targets
Improper feature categorization - Temporal features like order_day_of_week contain strings but were being treated as numeric
Missing error handling - No protection against invalid correlations or ANOVA calculations
Key fixes:

Separated temporal features into temporal_numeric (year, month, quarter) and temporal_categorical (day names)
Added type checking before correlation calculations
Enhanced error handling with try-except blocks
Added validation for correlation and ANOVA results
Now run the analysis again:

python
results = run_complete_analysis(df, feature_cols, target_cols)
The code will now properly handle:

Numeric correlations (quantity, discount, etc. vs sales)
Categorical ANOVA (segment, region, day_of_week vs sales)
String/categorical features without trying to force numeric operations
This should resolve the ValueError and provide meaningful relationship insights!

TypeError: agg function failed [how->mean,dtype->object]
Edit
The error occurs because the code is trying to calculate mean/std on categorical targets like sales_performance_category which contains strings ('Low', 'Medium', 'High', 'Very High'). Let me fix the descriptive statistics section:


Comprehensive Feature-Target Relationship Analysis
Code ∙ Version 5 
I also need to fix the chi-square analysis section to handle the case where we're comparing categorical features with categorical targets properly:


Comprehensive Feature-Target Relationship Analysis
Code ∙ Version 6 
The main fixes:

Descriptive Statistics: Now properly handles both numeric and categorical targets
For numeric targets: calculates mean, std, min, max
For categorical targets: creates cross-tabulation frequency tables
Chi-Square Analysis: Added better validation
Prevents comparing target with itself
Validates contingency table before analysis
Better error handling
Enhanced Error Handling: Added try-except blocks with informative messages
Now the analysis should handle all your target variables properly:

Numeric targets (sales, profit, profit_margin, etc.): Will get correlation analysis, ANOVA, and descriptive statistics
Categorical targets (sales_performance_category): Will get chi-square analysis and cross-tabulation
Try running the analysis again:

python
results = run_complete_analysis(df, feature_cols, target_cols)
This should now complete without errors and provide meaningful insights for all target types!




I have a sales dataset with the following data:

'order_id', 'order_date', 'ship_date', 'customer', 'manufactory',
       'product_name', 'segment', 'category', 'subcategory', 'region', 'zip',
       'city', 'state', 'discount', 'profit', 'quantity', 'sales',
       'profit_margin'
I want to add to it socio-economic characteristics by zip code. What specific characteristics would you suggest? Where can I pull them from?

Edit
Here are the most valuable socio-economic characteristics to add by zip code for sales analysis:

Core Demographics
Population & Density: Total population, population density
Age Distribution: Median age, % under 18, % 18-64, % 65+
Household Composition: Average household size, % families with children
Education: % high school graduates, % bachelor's degree+, % advanced degrees
Economic Indicators
Income: Median household income, median family income, per capita income
Income Distribution: % households earning <$25k, $25k-$75k, $75k-$150k, >$150k
Employment: Unemployment rate, % white collar jobs, % blue collar jobs
Poverty: % below poverty line, % children in poverty
Housing & Cost of Living
Housing: Median home value, median rent, % homeowners vs renters
Cost of Living Index: Overall cost index, housing cost index
Consumer Behavior Proxies
Internet Access: % with broadband internet (indicates online shopping potential)
Commuting: % work from home, average commute time
Vehicle Ownership: % households with vehicles

Data Limitations & Solutions
ZIP Code Changes
ZIP codes can be discontinued/created
Solution: Use ZIP Code Tabulation Areas (ZCTAs) which are more stable
Sample Size Issues
1-year ACS estimates unavailable for small populations
Solution: Fall back to 5-year estimates for consistency
Timing Mismatch
ACS data released with ~1 year lag
Solution: Use most recent available year for current analysis
Business Applications
This historical socio-economic data will enable:

Market Evolution Analysis: Track how demographic changes affect sales patterns
Economic Sensitivity Modeling: Understand recession/recovery impacts by market
Pricing Optimization: Adjust historical pricing strategies based on local economic conditions
Customer Lifetime Value: Factor in local economic trends for CLV predictions
Market Entry Timing: Identify optimal timing for new market entry based on economic indicators

I am getting
Error fetching data for 01453, 2020: Expecting value: line 2 column 1 (char 1) Error fetching data for 01752, 2020: Expecting value: line 2 column 1 (char 1) Error fetching data for 01810, 2020: Expecting value: line 2 column 1 (char 1) Error fetching data for 01841, 2020: Expecting value: line 2 column 1 (char 1) Error fetching data for 01852, 2020: Expecting value: line 2 column 1 (char 1) Error fetching data for 02038, 2020: Expecting value: line 2 column 1 (char 1)

Edit
The error "Expecting value: line 2 column 1 (char 1)" indicates the Census API is returning empty or malformed responses. This is common with Census data due to several issues. Let me provide a more robust solution:


Robust Census Data Fetcher with Error Handling
Code 
The main issues causing your errors are:

Common Problems & Solutions
ZIP Code Format: Census expects 5-digit ZIP codes (01453, not 1453)
Data Availability: Not all ZIP codes have 1-year ACS data
Rate Limiting: Too many rapid requests can cause failures
Empty Responses: Some ZIP/year combinations simply don't exist
Key Improvements in the New Code
Multiple Fallback Strategies:
Try 1-year ACS first (most current)
Fall back to 5-year ACS (better coverage)
Use minimal variable set if needed
Better Error Handling:
Validates response status and content
Handles JSON parsing errors
Continues processing even if some ZIP codes fail
Rate Limiting: Prevents overwhelming the Census API
Data Quality Checks: Validates data structure before processing
Usage
python
# Get your free API key from: https://api.census.gov/data/key_signup.html
API_KEY = "your_census_api_key_here"

# Fetch and merge socioeconomic data
df_enhanced = get_socioeconomic_data(df, API_KEY)

# Check what data was successfully retrieved
print("Sample of merged data:")
print(df_enhanced[['zip', 'order_year', 'median_household_income', 'total_population', 'dataset_used']].head())

# Check coverage by ZIP code
coverage = df_enhanced.groupby('zip')['median_household_income'].apply(lambda x: (~x.isna()).mean())
print(f"\nAverage coverage per ZIP code: {coverage.mean():.1%}")
Expected Results
Some ZIP codes will have complete data
Others may have partial data (fewer variables)
Some may have no data (very small or new ZIP codes)
The code will tell you which dataset was used and overall coverage
This robust approach should handle the API issues you're experiencing and maximize the amount of socioeconomic data you can retrieve!




Where do I get the census API key?

Edit
You can get a free Census API key here:

Official Census API Key Registration
URL: https://api.census.gov/data/key_signup.html

Registration Process
Go to the registration page above
Fill out the simple form:
Organization name (can be your company or "Personal Use")
Email address
Intended usage (e.g., "Business analytics and market research")
Submit the form
Check your email - you'll receive the API key immediately or within a few minutes
Key Details
Cost: Completely free
Usage Limits: 500 requests per IP address per day (generous for most use cases)
No approval required: Instant access
Valid indefinitely: Keys don't expire unless misused
After Getting Your Key
python
# Replace with your actual key
API_KEY = "your_actual_api_key_here"  # Will look like: "a1b2c3d4e5f6..."

# Test the key works
import requests
test_url = f"https://api.census.gov/data/2020/acs/acs5?get=B19013_001E&for=zip%20code%20tabulation%20area:90210&key={API_KEY}"
response = requests.get(test_url)
print("API Key test:", "Success" if response.status_code == 200 else "Failed")
Alternative: No-Key Option
If you prefer not to register, you can try without a key (but with much lower rate limits):

python
# Remove &key={API_KEY} from URLs
url = f"{base_url}?get={var_string}&for=zip%20code%20tabulation%20area:{zip_code}"
However, I strongly recommend getting the API key because:

Higher rate limits (500 vs ~50 requests/day)
More reliable access
Better for batch processing your ZIP codes
The registration is quick and the Census Bureau is very responsive about providing keys for legitimate research and business use!




This is not working. Can you point me to a URL that will allow me to download the data I need in a zip file?

Edit
You're right - the API approach can be frustrating. Here are direct download options for Census socio-economic data:

Option 1: Census Bureau Data Download Center (Recommended)
URL: https://data.census.gov/

Steps:

Go to data.census.gov
Click "Advanced Search"
Select:
Survey: American Community Survey 1-Year or 5-Year Estimates
Year: Your target years (2019, 2020, etc.)
Geography: ZIP Code Tabulation Area (ZCTA)
Topic: Income, Education, Demographics
Download as CSV files
Option 2: Pre-Built ZIP Code Demographics (Easiest)
NHGIS (National Historical GIS)

URL: https://www.nhgis.org/
Pre-processed Census data with easy downloads
Register for free account
Filter by: Geography (ZIP codes), Years, Variables
Download as CSV/Excel
Option 3: Census FTP Site (Bulk Download)
URL: https://www2.census.gov/programs-surveys/acs/data/

Structure:

/2020/5-year/data/
  ├── B19013_median-household-income.zip
  ├── B01003_total-population.zip  
  ├── B25077_median-home-value.zip
  └── ...
Option 4: Third-Party Processed Data
Social Explorer
URL: https://www.socialexplorer.com/
Has free tier with census data downloads
Pre-formatted for analysis
PolicyMap
URL: https://www.policymap.com/

ZIP code level data downloads
Option 5: Python Package Alternative
If you want to try one more programmatic approach that's more reliable:

python
# Install: pip install cenpy
import cenpy as cen
import pandas as pd

# This package handles the API complexity for you
products = cen.products.ACS(2020)
variables = products.variables

# Download data for specific variables and geographies
data = products.from_zipcode(['01453', '01752'], 
                           variables=['B19013_001E', 'B01003_001E'])
Recommended Approach
For your immediate needs, I'd suggest:

Start with NHGIS (Option 2) - it's the most user-friendly
Download 2019-2022 ACS 5-year estimates for all US ZIP codes
Key variables to download:
B19013_001E (Median household income)
B01003_001E (Total population)
B01002_001E (Median age)
B25077_001E (Median home value)
B15003_022E (Bachelor's degree)
B23025_005E (Unemployed)
This will give you a comprehensive dataset that you can then filter and merge with your sales data locally, avoiding API issues entirely.

Would you like me to walk you through the NHGIS download process step-by-step?




IN
feature_analysis
{'numeric_continuous': ['customer_monetary_value', 'customer_avg_order_value', 'unit_price', 'discount_amount', 'order_total', 'revenue_per_unit', 'profit_per_unit'], 'numeric_discrete': ['discount', 'quantity', 'order_processing_time', 'customer_frequency', 'customer_unique_orders', 'customer_recency', 'is_discounted'], 'categorical_low_cardinality': ['segment', 'category', 'subcategory', 'region', 'customer_rfm_segment', 'discount_category', 'order_size_category'], 'categorical_high_cardinality': ['customer', 'manufactory', 'product_name', 'city', 'state', 'region_state'], 'identifiers': ['zip'], 'temporal_numeric': ['order_month', 'order_year', 'order_quarter'], 'temporal_categorical': ['order_date', 'ship_date', 'order_day_of_week']}

how do I move 'discount' into 'numeric_contonuous'?

Edit
You can modify the feature categorization by directly updating the dictionary. Here are a few ways to do it:

Option 1: Direct Dictionary Manipulation
python
# Move 'discount' from numeric_discrete to numeric_continuous
feature_analysis['numeric_continuous'].append('discount')
feature_analysis['numeric_discrete'].remove('discount')

print("Updated categories:")
print(f"Numeric continuous: {feature_analysis['numeric_continuous']}")
print(f"Numeric discrete: {feature_analysis['numeric_discrete']}")
Option 2: Recreate the Lists
python
# Remove discount from numeric_discrete
feature_analysis['numeric_discrete'] = [col for col in feature_analysis['numeric_discrete'] if col != 'discount']

# Add discount to numeric_continuous
feature_analysis['numeric_continuous'] = feature_analysis['numeric_continuous'] + ['discount']
Option 3: Modify the Categorization Logic (If You're Re-running)
If you want to permanently change how discount is categorized, modify the categorize_features function:

python
# In the categorize_features function, add a special case for discount
elif pd.api.types.is_numeric_dtype(df[col]):
    # Special handling for discount - treat as continuous
    if col == 'discount':
        categories['numeric_continuous'].append(col)
    else:
        # Check if it's temporal numeric
        if any(x in col.lower() for x in ['month', 'year', 'quarter', 'day_of_week']):
            categories['temporal_numeric'].append(col)
        else:
            unique_ratio = df[col].nunique() / len(df)
            if unique_ratio > 0.05:  # Continuous if >5% unique values
                categories['numeric_continuous'].append(col)
            else:
                categories['numeric_discrete'].append(col)
Option 4: Create a Custom Override Function
python
def override_feature_categories(feature_analysis, overrides):
    """
    Apply manual overrides to feature categorization
    
    overrides: dict like {'discount': 'numeric_continuous'}
    """
    for feature, new_category in overrides.items():
        # Remove from all categories
        for category_list in feature_analysis.values():
            if feature in category_list:
                category_list.remove(feature)
        
        # Add to new category
        if new_category in feature_analysis:
            feature_analysis[new_category].append(feature)
    
    return feature_analysis

# Usage
overrides = {
    'discount': 'numeric_continuous',
    # Add more overrides if needed
}

feature_analysis = override_feature_categories(feature_analysis, overrides)
The simplest approach is Option 1 - just move it directly:

python
feature_analysis['numeric_continuous'].append('discount')
feature_analysis['numeric_discrete'].remove('discount')
This makes sense because discount values like 0.0, 0.1, 0.15, 0.2, etc. are better treated as continuous rather than discrete categories for correlation analysis.

I want to create visualizations for the relations that made it to EXECUTIVE SUMMARY OF FEATURE-TARGET RELATIONSHIPS

Edit
Looking at your executive summary, I'll create visualizations for the key relationships identified. Here's the code to generate comprehensive visualizations:


Feature-Target Relationship Visualizations
Code 
This comprehensive visualization code creates multiple charts specifically for the relationships that made it to your executive summary:

Key Visualizations Created:
1. Sales Target (Strongest Relationships)
Unit Price vs Sales - Scatter plot showing the strong positive correlation (r=0.889)
Discount Amount vs Sales - Shows the moderate positive relationship (r=0.610)
Sales by Category - Box plot demonstrating category's strong effect (F=265.47)
2. Profit Margin Target
Discount vs Profit Margin - Scatter plot showing the strong negative impact (r=-0.864)
Profit Margin by Discount Category - Box plots showing dramatic differences (F=7172.36)
Profit Margin by Region - Regional variations (F=260.16)
3. Profit Target
Profit Per Unit vs Profit - Shows the strongest correlation (r=0.912)
Unit Price vs Profit - Moderate positive relationship (r=0.468)
Profit by Discount Category - How discounts hurt profit (F=187.39)
4. Revenue Per Unit & Profit Per Unit
Category and subcategory breakdowns
RFM segment analysis
Discount impact visualizations
5. Sales Performance Category (Chi-Square Results)
Stacked bar charts showing how categories, subcategories, and order sizes relate to sales performance levels
Bonus Visualizations:
Correlation heatmap of all key variables
Detailed category analysis with violin plots
Comprehensive discount impact analysis
Usage:
python
# Run all executive summary visualizations
run_all_executive_summary_visualizations(df)
This will create a comprehensive set of visualizations that directly correspond to your executive summary findings, making it easy to present and understand the key relationships driving your business metrics!




Let's do it simpler.

I need two functions:
1. A function that will create a visualization for a correlation
2. A function that will create a visualization for a categorical relationship

Both functions will have the name of data_field and target_target as inputs.

Edit
Here's a simple, clean approach with two focused functions:


Simple Relationship Visualization Functions
Code 
Perfect! Here are your two simple functions:

Core Functions:
1. plot_correlation(df, data_field, target_field)
Creates scatter plot with correlation line
Shows correlation coefficient and strength
Best for numeric vs numeric relationships
2. plot_categorical(df, data_field, target_field)
Creates box plots for categorical vs numeric
Creates stacked bar charts for categorical vs categorical
Automatically detects target type and chooses appropriate chart
Includes summary statistics
Usage Examples:
python
# From your executive summary - strongest correlations
plot_correlation(df, 'unit_price', 'sales')           # r=0.889
plot_correlation(df, 'discount', 'profit_margin')     # r=-0.864
plot_correlation(df, 'profit_per_unit', 'profit')     # r=0.912

# From your executive summary - strongest categorical relationships
plot_categorical(df, 'category', 'sales')             # F=265.47
plot_categorical(df, 'discount_category', 'profit_margin')  # F=7172.36
plot_categorical(df, 'subcategory', 'sales')          # F=155.87
Bonus Function:
quick_plot(df, data_field, target_field)
Automatically detects if data_field is numeric or categorical
Calls the appropriate function for you
Perfect when you're not sure which visualization to use
python
# These automatically choose the right visualization:
quick_plot(df, 'unit_price', 'sales')        # → correlation plot
quick_plot(df, 'category', 'sales')          # → categorical plot
quick_plot(df, 'discount', 'profit_margin')  # → correlation plot
Clean, simple, and focused on exactly what you need! Each function handles the data type detection and creates publication-ready visualizations with proper titles, labels, and statistics.

This is my code:

feature_analysis['categorical_low_cardinality'].append('is_discounted')
feature_analysis['numeric_discrete'].remove('is_discounted')

print(feature_analysis)

{'numeric_continuous': ['customer_monetary_value', 'customer_avg_order_value', 'unit_price', 'discount_amount', 'order_total', 'revenue_per_unit', 'profit_per_unit', 'discount'], 'numeric_discrete': ['quantity', 'order_processing_time', 'customer_frequency', 'customer_unique_orders', 'customer_recency'], 'categorical_low_cardinality': ['segment', 'category', 'subcategory', 'region', 'customer_rfm_segment', 'discount_category', 'order_size_category', 'is_discounted'], 'categorical_high_cardinality': ['customer', 'manufactory', 'product_name', 'city', 'state', 'region_state'], 'identifiers': ['zip'], 'temporal_numeric': ['order_month', 'order_year', 'order_quarter'], 'temporal_categorical': ['order_date', 'ship_date', 'order_day_of_week']}

results = run_complete_analysis(df, feature_cols, target_cols)

and this is the output:

Why is correlation calculated for is_discounted?

Edit
The correlation is being calculated for is_discounted because your analysis code is looking at ALL numeric columns, regardless of how you've categorized them in feature_analysis.

Looking at your analysis code, this section is the issue:

python
# Only use truly numeric features for correlation
numeric_features = (feature_categories['numeric_continuous'] + 
                   feature_categories['numeric_discrete'] + 
                   feature_categories['temporal_numeric'])

if pd.api.types.is_numeric_dtype(df[target]):
    correlations = {}
    for feature in numeric_features:
        if feature in df.columns and pd.api.types.is_numeric_dtype(df[feature]):  # <-- This is the problem
Even though you moved is_discounted to categorical_low_cardinality, the code still checks pd.api.types.is_numeric_dtype(df[feature]) for each feature. Since is_discounted contains 0s and 1s, pandas considers it numeric, so it gets included in correlation analysis.

Fix Options:
Option 1: Update the analysis code to respect your categorization
Change this line in your analysis function:

python
# From this:
if feature in df.columns and pd.api.types.is_numeric_dtype(df[feature]):

# To this:
if feature in df.columns:
Option 2: Convert is_discounted to string/categorical in your DataFrame
python
# Convert to categorical so pandas doesn't see it as numeric
df['is_discounted'] = df['is_discounted'].astype('category')
# or
df['is_discounted'] = df['is_discounted'].map({0: 'No', 1: 'Yes'})
Option 3: Exclude it explicitly in the analysis code
python
# Add exclusion list
categorical_as_numeric = ['is_discounted']  # Add other binary flags here

for feature in numeric_features:
    if feature in df.columns and pd.api.types.is_numeric_dtype(df[feature]) and feature not in categorical_as_numeric:
Option 1 is cleanest - it makes your feature categorization actually control the analysis behavior, which is what you'd expect.

results = run_complete_analysis(df, feature_cols, target_cols)

Same result:

Edit
You're still seeing is_discounted in the correlation analysis because there's a mismatch between your updated feature_analysis dictionary and the feature_cols list being passed to the function.

The Problem:
Your run_complete_analysis function calls categorize_features(df, feature_cols) which recreates the feature categorization from scratch, ignoring your manual changes to feature_analysis.

The Solution:
You need to pass your modified feature_analysis directly to the analysis function instead of letting it recreate the categorization.

Here's how to fix it:


Simple Relationship Visualization Functions
Code ∙ Version 2 

Simple Relationship Visualization Functions
Code ∙ Version 3 
Now you can use your modified feature_analysis:

python
# Your modified feature analysis
feature_analysis['categorical_low_cardinality'].append('is_discounted')
feature_analysis['numeric_discrete'].remove('is_discounted')

# Pass it to the analysis function
results = run_complete_analysis(df, feature_cols, target_cols, feature_analysis)
Alternative Quick Fix:

If you don't want to modify the functions, just remove is_discounted from your feature_cols list:

python
# Remove is_discounted from the feature list entirely
feature_cols_modified = [col for col in feature_cols if col != 'is_discounted']
results = run_complete_analysis(df, feature_cols_modified, target_cols)
The first approach is cleaner because it lets you control exactly how each feature should be treated in the analysis.




You provided a wriong code...

Edit
You're absolutely right! I provided the wrong function names. Looking at your actual code, the functions are different. Here's the correct fix:

python
def analyze_feature_target_relationships(df, feature_cols, target_cols, feature_analysis=None):
    """
    Comprehensive analysis of relationships between features and targets
    """
    
    # Categorize features by type (use provided categorization if available)
    if feature_analysis is None:
        feature_analysis = categorize_features(df, feature_cols)
    
    # ... rest of your existing code stays the same

def run_complete_analysis(df, feature_cols, target_cols, feature_analysis=None):
    """
    Run the complete relationship analysis
    """
    # Main analysis
    results = analyze_feature_target_relationships(df, feature_cols, target_cols, feature_analysis)
    
    # Generate summary
    generate_summary_report(results)
    
    return results
Then use it like this:

python
# Your modified feature analysis
feature_analysis['categorical_low_cardinality'].append('is_discounted')
feature_analysis['numeric_discrete'].remove('is_discounted')

# Pass it to the analysis function
results = run_complete_analysis(df, feature_cols, target_cols, feature_analysis)
Or the simpler approach - just exclude is_discounted from your feature list:

python
feature_cols_no_discount_flag = [col for col in feature_cols if col != 'is_discounted']
results = run_complete_analysis(df, feature_cols_no_discount_flag, target_cols)
Sorry for the confusion with the wrong function names!

I have a sales dataset with the following fields:

'order_id', 'order_date', 'ship_date', 'customer', 'manufactory',

       'order_size_category', 'sales_performance_category'
Please suggest ways to analyze and visualize
* Sales trends over time with seasonality
* High-sales periods

Edit
Here are some effective ways to analyze and visualize sales trends and high-sales periods with your dataset:

Sales Trends Over Time with Seasonality
Time Series Analysis:

Create monthly/quarterly sales trend lines using order_month, order_year, and sales fields
Use moving averages (3-month, 12-month) to smooth out noise and reveal underlying trends
Decompose the time series to separate trend, seasonal, and residual components
Compare year-over-year growth rates by overlaying multiple years on the same chart
Seasonal Pattern Visualization:

Heatmaps showing sales intensity by month vs. year - great for spotting seasonal patterns across multiple years
Polar/radial charts with months as angles and sales as radius to highlight cyclical patterns
Box plots by month to show sales distribution and identify consistently high/low performing periods
Day-of-week analysis using order_day_of_week to find weekly patterns
High-Sales Periods Identification
Peak Detection Methods:

Calculate rolling percentiles (95th, 99th) to define "high-sales" thresholds
Use order_quarter and sales_performance_category if it contains performance tiers
Create anomaly detection charts highlighting periods significantly above trend
Build cumulative sales curves to identify acceleration periods
Comparative Analysis:

Calendar heatmaps showing daily sales intensity - excellent for spotting specific high-sales dates
Waterfall charts showing month-to-month or quarter-to-quarter sales changes
Sparklines for each product category/region to identify which drive peak periods
Ridge plots comparing sales distributions across different time periods
Advanced Visualizations
Interactive Dashboards:

Multi-level drill-down from yearly → quarterly → monthly → daily views
Filters by region, category, segment to analyze trends by business dimension
Correlation matrices between discount, profit_margin, and sales during peak periods
Segmented Analysis:

Compare trends across customer_rfm_segment to see if high-value customers drive peaks
Analyze discount_category impact during high-sales periods
Regional comparison using region_state to identify geographic seasonality differences
Key Metrics to Track
Sales velocity: Rate of change in sales over time
Seasonal indices: How much each period deviates from average
Peak duration: How long high-sales periods typically last
Recovery time: How quickly sales return to baseline after peaks
Contribution analysis: Which products/regions/segments drive peak performance
Would you like me to create specific visualizations for any of these approaches, or would you prefer to dive deeper into a particular analysis method?




Now, please suggest Python code for all that, except the dashboard. The code should also collect a summary into a text variable for further analysis by an LLM.

Edit
Here's comprehensive Python code for analyzing sales trends, seasonality, and high-sales periods with summary generation:


Sales Trends and Seasonality Analysis
Code 



I ned code that would analyze dataframe df, not a csv file

Edit

Sales Trends and Seasonality Analysis
Code ∙ Version 2 
Perfect! The code is now designed to work directly with your existing DataFrame df. Here's how to use it:

Key features of the updated code:

Direct DataFrame Input: The run_complete_analysis(df) function takes your existing DataFrame as input
No File Reading: All analysis is performed on the DataFrame you pass in
Comprehensive Analysis: Includes all the visualizations and statistical tests we discussed
LLM-Ready Summary: Generates a detailed text summary stored in the summary_for_llm variable
To use the code:

python
# Assuming your DataFrame is already loaded as 'df'
summary_for_llm = run_complete_analysis(df)

# The summary is now ready for LLM analysis
print(summary_for_llm)
What the analysis will provide:

Time series trends with moving averages and growth rates
Seasonality patterns by month, quarter, and day of week
High-sales period identification using statistical thresholds
Contributing factor analysis comparing high vs normal sales periods
Visual outputs for all major findings
Comprehensive text summary with key insights, statistics, and business recommendations
The final summary_for_llm variable will contain a structured text summary perfect for feeding into another LLM for deeper insights, strategy recommendations, or report generation.

Edit
The error is occurring because the code is trying to create a date from just year and month without specifying a day. Let me fix this issue:


Sales Trends and Seasonality Analysis
Code ∙ Version 3 
The issue was in the date creation for monthly sales data. However, let me also add the missing imports at the beginning and make sure all required libraries are properly imported:


Sales Trends and Seasonality Analysis
Code ∙ Version 4 
Let me also fix another potential issue in the date creation. The problem might be more specific to how pandas handles the date assembly:


Sales Trends and Seasonality Analysis
Code ∙ Version 5 
Now the code should work properly. The main fixes I made:

Added missing imports: Added pandas as pd, numpy as np, matplotlib.pyplot as plt, and seaborn as sns at the top
Fixed date creation: Changed the way monthly dates are created to use a dictionary format that pandas can properly handle
The error was occurring because pandas was having trouble assembling the date from the DataFrame columns. The new approach explicitly tells pandas which column corresponds to year, month, and day, which should resolve the ValueError.

Try running the code again with these fixes!

Prompt and Responses:

You are an experienced Sales & Revenue Analyst focusing on the following questions: 1. What drives sales performance across different dimensions? 2. Which factors most impact revenue generation? 3. Where are the growth opportunities? The following analysis is key to answering these questions: a. Sales trends over time with seasonality b. Revenue drivers and correlations c. Predictive factors for high-sales periods. You have a dataset with the following columns: order_id, order_date, ship_date, customer, manufactory, product_name, segment, category, subcategory, region, zip, city, state, discount, profit, quantity, sales, profit_margin, order_processing_time, order_month, order_year, order_day_of_week, order_quarter, customer_frequency, customer_monetary_value, customer_unique_orders, customer_recency, customer_avg_order_value, customer_rfm_segment, unit_price, discount_amount, is_discounted, order_total, region_state, revenue_per_unit, profit_per_unit, discount_category, order_size_category, sales_performance_category.

The dataset is df.

Please suggest code for testing the following hypothesis:

Hypothesis 1: Higher unit prices drive increased sales, but potentially at the expense of profit margin.
The analysis shows a strong positive correlation between unit price, revenue per unit, and sales, but discounts (which reduce unit price) are strongly negatively correlated with profit margin.
* Investigation:
   * Segmentation: Analyze sales and profit margin across different product categories and subcategories. Are high-priced items in certain categories more profitable despite discounts? Are there categories where discounts significantly erode profit margin?
   * Regression Analysis: Model the relationship between unit price, discount amount, and profit margin. This can quantify the impact of price changes on profitability.
   * Threshold Analysis: Define price thresholds and analyze profit margin above and below those points. This can identify optimal pricing strategies.

The code should be concise and include visualizations, wherever needed.

Edit
Here's concise code to test your hypothesis about unit prices, sales, and profit margins:


Unit Price vs Sales & Profit Analysis
Code 
This comprehensive analysis tests your hypothesis through four key approaches:

1. Correlation Analysis - Examines the strength of relationships between unit price, sales, and profit margins with a visual heatmap

2. Segmentation Analysis - Breaks down performance by product category to identify where high prices work best and where discounts hurt margins most

3. Regression Analysis - Quantifies the exact impact of unit price and discount amount on profit margin, giving you coefficients to predict outcomes

4. Threshold Analysis - Creates price segments (low/medium/high) to find optimal pricing sweet spots and analyze performance at different price levels

Key Features:

Statistical significance testing to validate correlations
Visual dashboards showing relationships across categories
Predictive modeling to quantify price-profit relationships
Actionable insights identifying which categories benefit from premium pricing
The analysis will definitively prove or disprove whether higher unit prices drive sales at the expense of profit margins, and more importantly, show you where this trade-off exists and how to optimize pricing strategy by category and segment.

Run this code with your df dataset to get comprehensive insights into your pricing strategy effectiveness!

The dataset is df.
Please suggest code for testing the following hypothesis:

Hypothesis 2: Specific product categories and subcategories outperform others in driving overall revenue and profit.
The ANOVA analysis reveals significant differences in sales and profit across categories and subcategories.
* Investigation:
   * Deep Dive into Subcategories: Focus on the top and bottom performing subcategories identified in the descriptive statistics. Examine factors like average order value, customer frequency, and discount rates within these subcategories.
   * Market Basket Analysis: Explore which subcategories are frequently purchased together. This could reveal opportunities for bundled offers or cross-selling strategies to boost sales of less popular items.
   * Product Lifecycle Analysis: Investigate how sales and profit for each subcategory trend over time. Identify declining categories and explore strategies for revitalization or phasing out.

The code should be concise and include visualizations, wherever needed.

Edit
Here's concise code to test your hypothesis about product category and subcategory performance:


Category & Subcategory Performance Analysis
Code 
This comprehensive analysis tests your hypothesis through five key approaches:

1. ANOVA Analysis - Statistical testing to prove significant differences exist between categories/subcategories in sales and profit performance

2. Category Performance Overview - Complete performance dashboard showing total sales, profit, average order value, and profit margins by category

3. Subcategory Deep Dive - Detailed analysis of top/bottom performers with key metrics like customer frequency and discount rates

4. Market Basket Analysis - Identifies which subcategories are frequently bought together using support, confidence, and lift metrics for cross-selling opportunities

5. Product Lifecycle Analysis - Time-series analysis showing growth trends and identifying declining vs growing subcategories

Key Features:

Statistical validation using ANOVA to prove hypothesis significance
Performance rankings identifying clear winners and losers
Cross-selling insights from market basket analysis
Growth trajectory mapping for strategic planning
Actionable recommendations for resource allocation
What You'll Learn:

Which categories drive the most revenue and profit
Specific subcategories to prioritize or phase out
Cross-selling opportunities to boost underperforming items
Time-based trends to inform product strategy
The analysis will definitively prove whether specific categories outperform others and provide concrete data on which ones to focus on for maximum revenue and profit impact!

Hypothesis 3: "Champion" customers contribute disproportionately to high-sales periods.
While the association between customer RFM segment and sales performance category is weak, the average sales for Champions are notably higher.
* Investigation:
   * Cohort Analysis: Track the purchasing behavior of Champion customers over time. Do they consistently contribute to high sales, or is their influence concentrated during specific periods?
   * Customer Lifetime Value (CLV) Analysis: Calculate the CLV for each RFM segment. This can justify investments in retaining and growing the Champion segment.

The code should be concise and include visualizations, wherever needed.

Champion Customer Analysis & High-Sales Period Contribution
Code ∙ Version 2 
The issue was that the attrgetter import was missing from the imports at the top. I've fixed it by adding from operator import attrgetter to the import statements.

Alternatively, if you're still having issues, you can replace that specific line with a simpler approach:


Champion Customer Analysis & High-Sales Period Contribution
Code ∙ Version 3 
I've also updated the code to remove the attrgetter dependency completely by using a lambda function instead. This should resolve the error and allow the cohort analysis to run properly. The code now calculates the period number (months since first order) in a more straightforward way that doesn't require the attrgetter function.

Prompt:

I am getting Query error: Invalid table-valued function ML.FEATURE_IMPORTANCE Model type LINEAR_REG is not supported by FEATURE_IMPORTANCE. at [4:3] at [38:1]

Response:

You're absolutely right to point that out! My apologies. The error message Model type LINEAR_REG is not supported by FEATURE_IMPORTANCE is very clear and indicates a limitation in BigQuery ML.

The ML.FEATURE_IMPORTANCE function in BigQuery ML is only supported for tree-based models like BOOSTED_TREE_REGRESSOR , BOOSTED_TREE_CLASSIFIER , RANDOM_FOREST_REGRESSOR , and RANDOM_FOREST_CLASSIFIER . It is not available for LINEAR_REG (linear regression) or LOGISTIC_REG (logistic regression) models.

This is because feature importance in linear/logistic regression is typically interpreted differently (e.g., through coefficient values or p-values), whereas tree models have a more direct way of calculating how much each feature contributes to splitting the data and reducing impurity/error.

How to Get Feature Importance/Insights for Linear and Logistic Regression Models in BigQuery ML:
While ML.FEATURE_IMPORTANCE isn't an option, you can still gain insights into which factors are most impactful for your LINEAR_REG and MULTI_CLASS_LOGISTIC_REG models using ML.WEIGHTS .

The ML.WEIGHTS function provides the learned weights (coefficients) for each feature in your model. A larger absolute weight indicates a stronger influence of that feature on the target variable. For categorical features that are one-hot encoded by BigQuery ML, you'll see a weight for each category.

Here's how you can use ML.WEIGHTS to understand feature importance for your existing models:

1. For your Sales Linear Regression Model ( sales_linear_regression_model ):

SELECT
  *
FROM
  ML.WEIGHTS(MODEL `mgmt599-myudanin-lab1`.assignment1.sales_linear_regression_model);
Generated code may be subject to license restrictions not shown here. Use code with care. Learn more 

Interpretation:

feature : The name of the input column.
weight : The coefficient assigned to that feature by the linear regression model.
A positive weight means that as the feature's value increases, sales tends to increase (holding other variables constant).
A negative weight means that as the feature's value increases, sales tends to decrease.
The magnitude (absolute value) of the weight indicates the strength of the relationship. Larger absolute weights suggest a more significant impact.
category_weights : For categorical features, you'll see details about individual categories and their specific weights.
2. For your Sales Performance Logistic Regression Model ( sales_performance_logistic_model ):

SELECT
  *
FROM
  ML.WEIGHTS(MODEL `mgmt599-myudanin-lab1`.assignment1.sales_performance_logistic_model);
Generated code may be subject to license restrictions not shown here. Use code with care. Learn more 

Interpretation:

For logistic regression, the weight indicates the change in the log-odds of the target class for a one-unit increase in the feature.
The interpretation of positive/negative magnitude is similar: a positive weight increases the likelihood of the predicted class, while a negative weight decreases it. The magnitude still relates to the strength of influence.
In multi-class logistic regression, you'll likely see weights for each feature per target class .
Important Considerations for ML.WEIGHTS :

Feature Scaling: If your numerical features are on very different scales (e.g., quantity vs. sales ), directly comparing their weights can be misleading. Features with larger scales might naturally have smaller weights, and vice-versa. BigQuery ML often handles some internal scaling, but it's something to be aware of if you were comparing models built with different tools.
Multicollinearity: If two or more independent variables are highly correlated, their individual weights might be less stable or harder to interpret. This is a general issue in regression, not specific to BigQuery ML.
Non-linear Relationships: Linear and logistic regression assume a linear relationship between features and the target (or log-odds of the target). If the true relationship is non-linear, these models might not fully capture it, and the weights would represent the best linear approximation.
By using ML.WEIGHTS , you can effectively analyze the impact of your different variables on sales (for linear regression) and sales_performance_category (for logistic regression), providing the insights you're looking for.

Key Features:

Feature Importance Calculation:

For numerical features: uses absolute weight values
For categorical features: sums absolute weights across all categories
Scales by R² to show actual explained variance portions


Two Visualization Types:

Pie Chart: Shows relative contribution with unexplained variance in gray
Bar Chart: Horizontal bars for easy feature name reading


Customizable:

Adjust the r_squared value to match your model's performance
Colors are automatically assigned with good contrast



To use with your full dataset:

Replace the truncated model_data with your complete JSON data
Set the correct r_squared value for your model
Run the script to get both visualizations

Key Insights from Your Data:
Based on the sample data shown, your most impactful features appear to be:

order_size_category: Especially "Bulk" and "Large" categories
discount_category: "Low Discount" has high impact
discount: Strong negative coefficient
quantity: Positive impact on the target

The visualization will help you immediately see which features drive your model's predictions and what portion of variance remains unexplained.
Would you like me to modify the visualization style or add any specific features to better suit your analysis needs?RetryMWhy
if name == "main":
?EditGreat question! The if __name__ == "__main__": construct is a Python idiom that's very useful for making code more modular and reusable. Let me explain:
What __name__ is:

__name__ is a built-in Python variable that contains the name of the current module
When a Python file is run directly (like python script.py), __name__ is set to "__main__"
When a file is imported as a module, __name__ is set to the actual module name

Why use it:
1. Code Organization
python# Without if __name__ == "__main__":
def my_function():
    return "Hello"

# This code runs immediately when file is imported OR executed
print("This always runs!")
my_function()

# With if __name__ == "__main__":
def my_function():
    return "Hello"

# This only runs when file is executed directly
if __name__ == "__main__":
    print("This only runs when script is executed directly")
    my_function()
2. Reusability
python# Other scripts can import your functions without running example code
from your_script import calculate_feature_importance, create_feature_importance_pie_chart

# The example usage won't execute, just the imports
3. Testing and Examples
python# You can include test cases and examples that don't interfere with imports
def add_numbers(a, b):
    return a + b

if __name__ == "__main__":
    # These tests only run when file is executed directly
    print("Testing add_numbers:")
    print(add_numbers(2, 3))  # Output: 5
In Your Case:
I used it because:

Functions can be imported: Other scripts can import calculate_feature_importance() and create_feature_importance_pie_chart() without running the example
Clean separation: The actual functionality (functions) is separate from the usage example
Professional practice: It's considered good Python style

You can remove it if you want:
If you're just running this as a standalone script and don't plan to import it elsewhere, you can absolutely remove the if __name__ == "__main__": line and just run the code directly:
python# Just run everything directly
r_squared = 0.75
importance = calculate_feature_importance(model_data, r_squared)
fig1, ax1 = create_feature_importance_pie_chart(importance)
plt.show()

Option 1: tab20 colormap (currently active)

Provides 20 distinct colors that are well-separated
Perfect for most feature importance visualizations

Option 2: hsv colormap (fallback)

Uses the full hue spectrum with strategic spacing
Avoids the red wrap-around issue by stopping at 0.9
Good for when you have more than 20 features

Option 3: Manual colors (commented out)

Hand-picked colors for maximum control

Easily customizable for your preferences

Additional alternatives you could try:
python# For even more distinct colors, try these:
colors = plt.cm.Set1(np.linspace(0, 1, min(9, len(labels)-1)))  # Max 9 very distinct colors

# or
colors = plt.cm.Paired(np.linspace(0, 1, min(12, len(labels)-1)))  # 12 paired colors
The tab20 option should give you much better color separation than Set3. Try it and let me know if you need further adjustments!RetryMIt puts orange next to red.

The new color strategy:

Red → Green → Blue → Orange → Purple → Cyan → etc.
No similar colors are placed next to each other
The sequence alternates between warm and cool colors
Each color is maximally different from its neighbors

How it works:

Small datasets (≤18 colors): Uses a carefully curated list with manual ordering for maximum contrast
Large datasets (>18 colors): Uses HSV color space with strategic spacing to avoid similar hues

The color sequence now follows:

            contrast_order = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 
                            20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, Perfect! Now you have 50 contrasting colors that are strategically ordered to maximize visual distinction between adjacent colors. Here's what the sequence looks like:
Color Progression (first 20):

Red → Green → Blue → Orange → Purple → Cyan
Olive → Pink → Brown → Bright Green → Navy → Yellow
Dark Purple → Bright Cyan → Bright Red → Dark Green → Bright Blue → Dark Orange
Indigo → Turquoise → Green Yellow → Crimson...

Key features:

No similar colors adjacent: Red is followed by Green (not Orange)
Brightness variation: Alternates between bright and muted tones
Hue diversity: Covers the full spectrum with maximum spacing
50 total colors: Should handle even very complex feature sets

The colors are arranged so that:

Warm colors (reds, oranges) are separated by cool colors (blues, greens)
Bright colors are interspersed with darker/muted colors
Similar hues are placed far apart in the sequence

This should give you excellent visual separation in your pie chart, making it easy to distinguish between adjacent segments even with many features!
